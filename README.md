# OpenAi-Discord-Bot
This repository contains code from a personal project where I made a discord bot which utilized the OpenAI API to get responses from the AI and post it on Discord upon a slash command.

Languages and libraries used:
-Javascript (node.js)
-discord.js: https://discord.js.org/#/
-openai.js: https://openai.com/api/

*important* 
When using this code, make sure to substitute your own special discord token, client ID in the json file. Same goes for the OpenAI api key.
