# OpenAi-Discord-Bot
This repository contains code from a personal project where I made a discord bot which utilized the OpenAI API to get responses from the AI and post it on Discord upon a slash command.

Languages and libraries used:
-Javascript (node.js)
-discord.js: https://discord.js.org/#/
-openai.js: https://openai.com/api/

Steps before getting started:

Discord:
Set up your discord developers account.
Create an application for your bot.
Retrieve both the token and the client id to insert in the config.json file.

OpenAI:
create an account with openAI
retrieve the API key

Next:
Download all the files in this repository.
Change the name of config copy to just config.json
write npm install on the terminal to install the node modules and other dependancies that were used in the project.



*important* 
When using this code, make sure to substitute your own special discord token, client ID in the json file. Same goes for the OpenAI api key.
